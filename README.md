# Modal Logic
### Class project for Logic in computer science

We extended the propositional logic and its semantics. More about modal logic can be found [here]{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_logic}.
Modal logic brings in the notion of necessity (box) and possibility (diamond).
We proved the soundness theorem for modal logic and some theorems.

Project is divided into several files. 
The semantics is defined in `Soundness.agda` where is also the soundness proof.
